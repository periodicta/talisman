# Talisman
A text-based implementation of Talisman 4th Edition Revised built in Sugarcube 2. Currently v0.1, early alpha stages of development.

Also included in the repository are several original versions of the text-based adaptation written in Python, first in a function-based system and then in an object-oriented framework.
